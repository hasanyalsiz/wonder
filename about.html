                <p class="break-words" style="font-size: .8rem;">The Wordery story begins with five friends. Between
                    them, they’ve
                    worked in the
                    book trade for more
                    than 40 years and all share a passion for reading. <br><br>
                    They believed that online retail had diminished the enjoyment of buying books, that it had lost its
                    soul. So they decided to recapture its spirit with an ambitious venture to establish an alternative
                    online bookshop.<br><br>

                    A place where booklovers could discover new reads and chat to helpful staff with a genuine
                    enthusiasm for all things bound. It would, in short, be like a traditional bookshop. But with all
                    the convenience of an online store: great service, an outstanding choice, round-the-clock access,
                    excellent value, and – of course – free delivery to anywhere in the world.<br>
                    <br>
                    We’ve grown a lot since 2012. The initial team of five has expanded to 25, we process more than
                    25,000 orders on a busy day and have five million customers in over 100 countries.<br><br>

                    Despite our increased size, our passion for what we do remains the same. We want to share our love
                    of reading with the rest of the world.<br><br>

                    For example, we’re committed to working with charities to improve literacy among young people,
                    because we believe this is a crucial measure of a healthy society. We partner with national literacy
                    charities and a local primary school to engender a love of reading among pupils. It’s proving a real
                    success, and many children have discovered a love of literature as a result of our efforts.<br><br>

                    Never content with the status quo, we continue to innovate and grow Wordery globally. We always want
                    to offer the widest possible range of books online, naturally. Currently offering over 10 million
                    different titles, we are constantly on the lookout for new partners so that we can increase that
                    figure.<br><br>

                    We work closely with publishers, suppliers and authors to make sure you’ll always find the book you
                    want when you come to our online store. And as well as giving you all the choice you could wish for,
                    you can rest assured that delivery will always be completely free – wherever you’re located.<br><br>

                    We welcome your suggestions for the next chapter in our story. Or, perhaps you’d just like to say
                    hello. You can always reach us at hello@wordery.com. We'll look forward to hearing from you
                    soon.<br><br>

                    Until then, we hope you enjoy shopping at us.
